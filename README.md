Adventure Party Sim is a game about building adventurers and fighting monsters. Inspired by Kairosoft's title "Dungeon Village 2".

I love building character stats in video games. In Dungeon Village, I feel mostly free to build characters how I want.
There are a few things missing from that game, though. So I've decided to create a similar game that captures my desires!

Note: This game isn't intended to knock that beautiful classic off the shelves or anything, and I encourage everybody to go check it out
an support that developer! It's really a great game! But this game is designed to focus on the adventurers more-- It won't compare the DV2's
simulated economy!

What's this game's scope?

The core of this game is about training characters. Here's a list of tweaks We're importing (and overhaul) from Dungeon Village 2
 - Jobs. Here they fall into 2 categories: Adventurers & Workers. Adventurers fight monsters to gain levels, and Workers work to gain levels
 - Workers remain in the village and work, passively generating xp and other resources over time while also providing services to other villagers
 - Adventurers leave the village and fight monsters, earning xp and monster resources when beating monsters.
 - Adventure Party System. The player builds parties MANUALLY before leaving the village. These parties stick together and fight together when out

Otherwise, combat and progression flows similarly as in Dungeon Village 2. When out adventure parties pick fights with mobs, and fights occur in real time.

This game's feature will flesh out over time-- combat being the first priority, then growth, then village mechanics. In time the project will grow into a smaller,
more focused DV2-like experience.
